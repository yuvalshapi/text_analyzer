said the other gargoyle in a high- pitched voice.'
"Well, that's put us in our place, hasn't that?'"
Harry knocked.
"Harry heard footsteps, then the door opened and  Harry found  Harry face to face with Professor  McGonagall.   '"
You haven't been given another detention!'
"McGonagall said at once,  McGonagall square spectacles flashing alarmingly.   '"
"Aaaaaand- Lynch!`   Seven green blurs swept onto the field;  Harry spun a small dial on the side of  Harry Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word` Firebolt` on each of players brooms and see players names, embroidered in silver, upon players backs."
"` And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch,   Hassan Mostafa!`  A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle  Vernon's, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field."
"A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and  Vernon was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm,  Vernon broomstick under the other."
"Harry spun the speed dial on  Vernon Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as   Hassan Mostafa mounted  Vernon broomstick and kicked the crate open- four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and(  Harry saw Quaffle for the briefest moment, before Quaffle sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch."
"With a sharp blast on  Vernon whistle,   Hassan Mostafa shot into the air after the balls."
`Theeeeeeeey're OFF!` screamed  Bagman.` And air's  Mullet!
"Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding boy."
"Harry caught a glimpse of  Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering   Stewart Ackerley as boy sat down."
"For a fleeting second,  Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too."
"` Baddock,  Malcolm!` ` SLYTHERIN!`  The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers;  Harry could see  Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins."
Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other.
Fred and  George hissed   Malcolm Baddock as  Fred sat down.
"`  Branstone,  Eleanor!` ` HUFFLEPUFF!` ` Cauldwell,  Owen!` ` HUFFLEPUFF!` ` Creevey, Dennis!`  Tiny  Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over   Hagrid's moleskin, just as  Hagrid  Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers' table."
"About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad,  Hagrid, with  Hagrid long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming- a misleading impression, for  Harry,  Ron, and  Hermione knew  Hagrid to possess a very kind nature."
Hagrid winked at Harry and  Ron and  Hermione as  Hagrid sat down at the end of the staff table and watched  Dennis Creevey putting on the   Sorting Hat.
The rip at the brim openedwide---` GRYFFINDOR!` the hat shouted.
"Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as  Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed hat back on the stool, and hurried over to join  Dennis Creevey brother."
"`  Colin, I fell in!`  Dennis Creevey said shrilly, throwing  Dennis Creevey into an empty seat.` seat was brilliant!"
"And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!` ` Cool!` said  Colin, just as excitedly.` seat was probably the giant squid, Dennis!` ` Wow!` said Dennis, as though nobody in nobody wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm- tossed, fathoms- deep lake, and pushed out of lake again by a giant sea monster."
` Dennis!
Dennis!
