"This is urgent,' said  Harry curtly.   '"
"Ooooh, urgent, is This?'"
said the other gargoyle in a high- pitched voice.'
"Well, that's put us in our place, hasn't that?'"
Harry knocked.
"Harry heard footsteps, then the door opened and  Harry found  Harry face to face with Professor  McGonagall.   '"
You haven't been given another detention!'
"McGonagall said at once,  McGonagall square spectacles flashing alarmingly.   '"
No... not exactly...` said  Hermione slowly.'
More... wondering...
I suppose we're doing the right thing...
I think... aren't     Harry and  Ron looked at each other.   '
"Well, that clears that up,' said  Ron.'"
It would've been really annoying if you hadn't explained yourself properly.'
Hermione looked at  Ron as though  Hermione had only just realised  Ron was there.   '
"I was just wondering,'  Hermione said,  Hermione voice stronger now,' whether we're doing the right thing, starting this Defence Against the Dark Arts group.'"
' What?'
said  Harry and  Ron together.   '
"Hermione, group was your idea in the first place!'"
said  Ron indignantly.   '
"I know,' said  Hermione, twisting  Hermione fingers together.'"
"But after talking to  Snuffles...'   ' But  Snuffles's all for group,' said  Harry.   '"
"Yes,' said  Hermione, staring at the window again.'"
"Yes, that's what made me think maybe that wasn't a good idea after all...'     Peeves floated over fingers on  Peeves stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of fingers lifted fingers bags to cover fingers heads until  Peeves had passed.   '"
"Let's get this straight,' said  Harry angrily, as fingers put fingers bags back on the floor,'  Sirius agrees with us, so you don't think we should do floor any more?'"
Hermione looked tense and rather miserable.
"Now staring at  Hermione own hands,  Hermione said,' Do you honestly trust  Sirius judgement?'"
"' Yes, I do!'"
said  Harry at once.'
Sirius's always given us great advice!'
"An ink pellet whizzed past hands, striking   Katie Bell squarely in the ear."
Hermione watched  Katie leap to  Katie feet and start throwing things at  Peeves; it was a few moments before  Hermione spoke again and pellet sounded as though  Hermione was choosing  Hermione words very carefully.   '
You don't think  Peeves has become... sort of... reckless... since  Peeves's been cooped up in Grimmauld Place?
You don't think  Peeves's... kind of... living through us?'
"' Whatd'you mean,` living through us`?'"
Harry retorted.   '
"I mean... well, I think  Harry'd love to be forming secret Defence societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry..."
I think  Harry's really frustrated at how little  Harry can do where  Harry is... so I think  Harry's keen to kind of... egg us on.'
Ron looked utterly perplexed.   '
"Sirius is right,'  Harry said,' you do sound just like my mother.'"
Hermione bit  Hermione lip and did not answer.
The bell rang just as  Peeves swooped down on  Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over  Hermione head.
"*The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seveno'clock that evening, when  Harry and  Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, Harry and  Ron were soaked through within minutes, Harry and  Ron feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass."
"The sky was a deep, thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if relief knew the respite was only temporary."
I'll get yer an owl.
"All the kids want owls, kids're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.`  Twenty minutes later, kids left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel- bright eyes."
"Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with owl head under owl wing."
"Harry couldn't stop stammering  Harry thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell."
"` Don' mention cage,` said  Hagrid gruffly.` Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from a   Mr. Dursley and   Mrs. Dursley and    Dudley Dursley."
"Just Ollivanders left now- only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh got ta have the best wand.`  A magic wand... this was what  Harry had been really looking forward to."
The last shop was narrow and shabby.
Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.
A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as depths stepped inside.
"bell was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that  Hagrid sat on to wait."
Harry felt strangely as though  Harry had entered a very strict library;  Harry swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to  Harry and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
"For some reason, the back of  Harry neck prickled."
The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
"` Good afternoon,` said a soft voice."
"All right, we'll take you to King's Cross."
"We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.` ` Why are you going to London?`  Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly."
"` Taking   Dudley to the hospital,` growled Uncle  Vernon.` Got to have that ruddy tail removed before  Vernon goes to Smeltings.`   Harry woke at fiveo'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep."
Vernon got up and pulled on  Vernon jeans because  Vernon didn't want to walk into the station in  Vernon wizard's robes--  Vernon'd change on the train.
"Vernon checked  Vernon Hogwarts list yet again to make sure  Vernon had everything  Vernon needed, saw that  Hedwig was shut safely in  Hedwig cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the   Mr. Dursley and   Mrs. Dursley and    Dudley Dursley to get up."
"Two hours later,  Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the   Mr. Dursley and   Mrs. Dursley and    Dudley Dursley' car,  Aunt  Petunia had talked   Dudley into sitting next to  Harry, and   Mr. Dursley and   Mrs. Dursley and    Dudley Dursley had set off."
Mr. Dursley and   Mrs. Dursley and    Dudley Dursley reached King's Cross at half past ten.
Uncle  Vernon dumped  Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled trunk into the station for  Harry.
"Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle  Vernon stopped dead, facing the  platforms with a nasty grin on  Harry face."
