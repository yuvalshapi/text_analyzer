# Project Title / Student Name

## Extensions:

* Nice extension - does such and such.

* Silly extension - does something else, but only works for prime numbers.

Works by calling the perpetual motion library, which only works
on prime numbers. Solving for composite numbers would also require
a time machine.

## Design

We chose a perpetual motion machine over a time machine because
of the aging cost of moving to the past, and the dangerous paradoxes
which can arise.
